# <Refactor Homework-01>
## Description

- The purpose of this exercise was to, as a potential junior developer, refactor a completed code without changing the function or the display.

- I edited this project to practice refactoring code. As a junior developer it will be commonplace for me to refactor others' code. Making the code cleaner, more semantic, and more acessible.

- I learned many different semantic tags, and how to consolidate CSS, how to recognize bloated and redundant code. I practiced by changing the code of this webpage without changing a thing about its appearance or structure, thereby making it easier for collaborators to work with this code.

## The purpose of this webpage is to advertise Horiseon, a mockup digital marketing company:

-the webpage should look as follows:
![Horiseon](Horiseon.png)

## Changes to starter code:
-**Change div tags to semantic tags including...**
1. **header** - highlighting the top header text
2. **nav** - featuring the structure of the navbar to the top right
3. **figure** - highlighting the main background image in the center of the webpage
4. **main** - wrapping the main body of the code.
5. **section** - a section of content
6. **aside** - wrapping the sidebar content
7. **footer** - footer of the webpage

-**Removed superfluous attributes from html tags**

-**Added alt attributes to href images, for accessibility purposes as well as adding a title attribute to the figure as the image displayed is a background image without an applicable alt tag**

-**Consolidated many CSS selectors, either by adding common classes in the html, changing class selectors to more general tag selectors, or aligning the selector elements into one block to apply common styling change to them all.**
